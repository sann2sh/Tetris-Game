# 🎮 Tetris Game in C++ with Custom Graphics

This is a modified version of the [educ8s Tetris game](https://github.com/educ8s/Cpp-Tetris-Game-with-raylib), built using C++ and raylib.

🧑‍💻 Part of my **3rd semester Computer Graphics lab project**.
### 🛠️ Key Differences
- Replaced raylib's drawing functions with:
  - **Bresenham's Line Algorithm** for drawing rectangles
  - **Scanline Fill Algorithm** for coloring them

This adds low-level control over rendering, ideal for learning graphics fundamentals.

### ▶️ How to Run
- Open the project in **VS Code**
- Press **F5** to build and run (requires C++ and raylib setup)
